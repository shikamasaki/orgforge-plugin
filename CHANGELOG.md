# Changelog

All notable changes to orgforge-plugin. This project follows a pragmatic semver:
minor = new mechanisms/features, patch = fixes, major = breaking articulation changes.

## 0.4.1

Work-in-progress survives a context wipe. Half-done work now lives in the ledger, not in the
conversation, so `/clear` or a fresh session no longer loses "how far did we get."

### Added
- **Progress checkpoints** (`ledger-schema.yaml`). `cycle_started`/`cycle_completed` gain a
  `candidate_id` (in-flight is now per-item, not just a per-role count), and a new
  `progress_recorded {role, candidate_id, fraction, phase, done_so_far, next_step, blocked_by,
  artifacts}` event records "how far / what's done / the next step / any blocker" at each milestone.
- **`work_in_progress` view** (`ledger.py`). Resolves the candidates started-but-not-completed, each
  with its latest checkpoint — the recovery source after a context wipe.
- **Automatic resume injection** (`org_session_start.py`). The SessionStart hook now injects the role's
  work in progress alongside its doctrine — so a fresh session (after `/clear`, a crash, or a scheduled
  wake) picks up from `next_step` automatically, with no `/org-resume` needed. "Just continue" works.
- **`/org-resume`** — the manual counterpart: show a role's in-progress board and pick up an item.

### Changed
- **`/org-work` records as it goes.** The PM loop now checkpoints keyed by `candidate_id`
  (started → progress at each milestone → completed), and states the discipline explicitly: work only
  items that are on the backlog; submit first if it isn't, so nothing is invisible/unrecoverable.

## 0.4.0

The running metabolism: a department now has a driven backlog, a PM loop that delegates in
parallel, a self-improvement loop, and a scheduler wired to the harness's own loop — plus the
knowledge-aggregation guarantee made load-bearing, and two guardrail deadlocks fixed. Aligns the
plugin version with the autonomous-founding narrative the docs already describe (v0.3/v0.4).

### Added
- **Driven backlog with two intake paths** (`ledger-schema.yaml`, `attention.py`). `candidate_submitted`
  gains `source: mandate|self`; top-down instructions and self-raised tasks share one backlog
  (`open_experiments`) and are prioritized on one footing. An in-ranking **mandate rides a floor**
  (zone of acceptance, Simon 1947) so a live instruction is never starved by low-priority self work;
  an off-ranking mandate gets no floor (a visible drift signal). (docs/12)
- **The PM loop** (`/org-work <role>`). Select from the backlog by situated attention, delegate the
  selected items to subordinates **in parallel** (one `Task` each, where the split is genuine), record
  `cycle_completed`. Parallelism is a judgment, not a mandate.
- **The discovery loop** (`/org-discover <role>`). Problemistic search raises `source: self` backlog
  items from aspiration gaps, scoped to the role's own domain; append-only, fail-quiet when there is
  no gap. (docs/12)
- **Decomposition doctrine** (`docs/15`, projected into `ROLE.md`). How a manager splits an assignment,
  grounded in Parnas (information hiding), Simon (near-decomposability), Thompson (interdependence),
  Becker & Murphy (coordination cost), Conway. Never split reciprocal work; cut at the design secret;
  each child carries a seam contract; route another role's domain to that role.
- **Scheduler wiring** (`integrations/claude-code/SCHEDULER.md`). Realize `schedule.yaml`'s cadences on
  Claude Code's own scheduler (`/schedule`, `/loop`) — R0-conformant ("the harness's own loop"), no R0
  change, wiring confined to the integration layer.
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** — the whole-system map: ecosystem (neutral core → projection → harness, organs,
  enforcement vs advisory) and lifecycle (founding → projection → operation → guardrails → evolution).

### Changed
- **O8 no-doctrine-capture lint tooth** (`org_lint.py`). No control role may carry `implement` together
  with `judge`/`review` — a coordinator that produces a domain deliverable collapses maker and checker
  and pools domain knowledge in the boss instead of the field role that owns it (docs/08 §1.1, docs/15
  §3). Generalizes O6's "authorization holder must not implement" to every adjudicating seat.

### Fixed
- **Word-boundary destructive classification** (`org_hook.py`). The blast-radius classifier tested
  destructive tokens as substrings (`"rm " in cmd`, `"-f " in cmd`), so a path like `.../fx-ml-platform/…`
  or a flag like `grep -f` was miscounted as destructive and eventually blocked every command. Now
  tokenizes and matches on word boundaries; operators/dotted calls stay on tight-anchored regex.
- **Rolling-window deadlock** (`org_hook.py`). The blast-radius window was hardcoded to `1970-01-01`
  (all-time) while appended events were stamped `1970` too — read-window and write-ts diverged, so
  committed exposure accumulated forever and the cap eventually **blocked every edit**. Now a rolling
  **daily** window (both the append ts and the read window share one `_now_ts` clock); the budget
  resets each day with no operator action. `ORG_WINDOW=all` opts back into an all-time cap deliberately.

## 0.2.0

Hierarchical doctrine, refounding, delegation seams, and an operating-phase spine —
plus a redesigned blast-radius cap that no longer blocks normal work.

### Added
- **Hierarchical per-role doctrine hand-off** (`tools/handoff.py`). A manager hands each
  subordinate a packet: the child's slice, a **seam contract** (inputs/outputs/owns/forbid), and
  **doctrine scoped to that slice** — so knowledge narrows going down and splits by trade
  (`ui-worker` ≠ `api-worker` ≠ `db-worker`), and a parent's broader brain never leaks down. The
  runner (`run_department.py`) wires `ORG_DOCTRINE_ROOT` + `--plugin-dir` so a top-level launch
  fires the doctrine-injection hook automatically. (docs/07 §2.1)
- **Doctrine remap for refounding** (`doctrine.py remap`). When roles are renamed / split /
  merged, every live claim follows as an asset; a claim that maps to nothing **blocks** the
  refound rather than being silently lost. (docs/06 §4.4, docs/07 §2.2)
- **Spawn seam-contract gate** (`ORG_REQUIRE_SEAM=1`). An `Agent`/`Task` spawn is blocked unless
  its prompt carries a seam contract or an explicit `INDEPENDENT:` declaration — recursive splits
  can't drift on an un-owned interface. (docs/07 §2.1.1)
- **Silence-consent gate** (`guardrails.py consent`). A reversible backlog action rides the
  delegated tier (silence = consent, proceeds); an irreversible one (deploy/spend/destroy/…) holds
  for an explicit human ack. (docs/06 §2.1)
- **STALE-REFERENCE auto-trigger** (`guardrails.py staleref --auto`). Derives the trigger event +
  bound roles from the ledger's latest reference change, so a central re-prioritization propagates
  to departments without hand-fed arguments. (docs/11 §2.3, docs/12 §3.1)
- **DEPENDENCY-STALL dependency edges** (`reconcile.py stall`). Reads `work_claimed.depends_on`
  edges to report who a blocked role awaits, which downstream roles are impacted, and the
  lowest-common-owner to route to — instead of cycle timing alone. (docs/11 §2.4)
- **QUICKSTART.md** — install, the one required setting, guardrail tuning, and a verified
  "prove it blocks" snippet.

### Changed
- **Blast-radius cap now meters irreversibility, not activity.** The old flat "every file write
  costs 1 against a cap of 3" blocked a normal build at its 4th file. Now: creating a new file
  (decided by a filesystem stat), reads, and build tooling (`npm`, `pytest`, `git commit`) are
  **not metered**; the scarce low caps are reserved for `destructive_ops` (scope-weighted —
  `rm -rf` = 3), `external_writes`, `infra_changes`; overwriting an existing file is
  `file_mutations` (high cap 200). A 300-file build proceeds; `rm -rf` still hard-stops. New caps
  are tunable via `ORG_CAP_*`. (docs/11 §2.1)

### Docs
- Operating-phase flow integrated into existing homes (no new file): the two-level backlog
  (org-wide ranking + per-dept next-task) in docs/12 §3.1; the registrar as org-wide priority
  owner in docs/06 §2.6; reversible-vs-irreversible consent in docs/06 §2.1.
- New `examples/`: `doctrine-scoping` (per-role brains that narrow + refound remap), and
  `seam-descent-run` (an org self-driving scoped hand-offs end to end).

Every change ships with regression tests (76 green) and passes the payload-schema drift guard.

## 0.1.0

Initial template: the articulated organization as installable Claude Code features — PreToolUse
guardrails that block, SessionStart doctrine injection, per-department subagents, organ tools
(ledger, guardrails, doctrine, reconcile, resource, attention, learning), and organ slash-commands.
Verified on the real CLI (v2.1.211).
